## Project Overview
The project focuses on utilizing CNNs for image classification, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model. The primary objective is to identify and classify images based on the provided dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning library for building and training neural networks.
- **Keras**: High-level API for TensorFlow.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for plotting results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Dataset
Details about the dataset:
- Source: Specify the source (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset).
- Format: Mention the format (e.g., images in folders, `.csv` files with labels).
- Size: Number of samples in training, validation, and test sets.

Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Model Architecture
The model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras and includes:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts image data.
- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction using filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce dimensionality.
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts 2D data to 1D.
- **Dense Layers**: For classification.
- **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cnn-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `CNN1.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Define and compile the CNN model.
   - Train the model.
   - Evaluate the model on the test set.

## Results
- Accuracy: Provide the achieved accuracy.
- Loss: Provide the loss value.
- Visualization: Include sample plots (e.g., accuracy and loss curves, example classifications).

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with deeper architectures for improved performance.
- Implement data augmentation to handle limited datasets.
- Optimize hyperparameters using tools like Optuna or Hyperband.
- Integrate deployment options for real-world usage (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
